# Works
Here are some of my works.

## IMP interpreter

IMP is a tiny imperative language specially designed for giving a formal description on execution of a program: Operational Semantics.
Input a program and press run to see the derivation tree (based on big-step semantics).

## Lambda calculus interpreter

Lambda calculus is an absolute foundation of Functional programming languages.
It is simple yet powerful enough to encode ALL the programs run on computers (as same as Turing Machine).
Input an expression and press run to get the full reduction graph.
